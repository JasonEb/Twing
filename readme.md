# Twing

Twing is intended to be a "pointer" application. It will read messages from Twitch Chat, and output visual cues on the broadcast. 

## Technologies
React.js
Redux
Twitch API

The project intends to parse Twitch chat messages from a given channel, and have chat viewers interact with the broadcast by indicating visual aids or cues onto the the broadcast. For example, a chat viewer can enter "upper right" which will trigger a visual aid in the upper right corner of their stream.
